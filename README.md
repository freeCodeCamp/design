Design system, React component library, and vanilla-JS adapter that power the freeCodeCamp.org platform. Built CSS-first with design tokens and accessibility-tested against the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices.

UIKit is distributed as a **copy-source registry** (shadcn-style): components are copied from [design.freecodecamp.org](https://design.freecodecamp.org) into your project's source and tailored there - nothing installs from npm, nothing is packaged. It is built to be equally usable by humans and LLM coding agents: point an agent at [design.freecodecamp.org/llms.txt](https://design.freecodecamp.org/llms.txt) and it can discover, copy, and adapt any component.

## Packages

All workspaces are private - they are the source of truth the registry serves, not npm packages.

## Quick start

### React - copy the source

1. Install the theme once: copy `tokens.css` + `base.css` from [/registry/theme.md](https://design.freecodecamp.org/registry/theme.md) and import them globally (fonts: see the [starter guide](https://design.freecodecamp.org/registry/starter.md)).
2. Copy a component from its page - e.g. [/components/button.md](https://design.freecodecamp.org/components/button.md) - into `src/ui/<slug>/`, and import its CSS once.
3. It is your code now: tailor it freely, recolour by editing token values.

For agents: [/llms.txt](https://design.freecodecamp.org/llms.txt) (index) · [/registry/index.json](https://design.freecodecamp.org/registry/index.json) (machine-readable manifest) · [/registry/starter.md](https://design.freecodecamp.org/registry/starter.md) (bootstrap + AGENTS.md snippet).

```tsx
import './ui/theme/tokens.css';
import { Button } from './ui/button/Button';
import { Badge } from './ui/badge/Badge';

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button variant='cta'>Start curriculum</Button>
      <Badge tone='success'>Passed</Badge>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Documentation

The docs site (`apps/docs`) is the canonical reference: live component showcases, real React previews, the design handbook, and brand guide.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:docs
```

Then open <http://localhost:4321>.

The site ships at <https://design.freecodecamp.org> via Cloudflare Pages.

For the full component-by-component reference and how UIKit compares to Catalyst / Ark UI / Headless UI, see [docs/components-matrix.md](./docs/components-matrix.md).

## Deployment

- **Docs site** → Cloudflare Pages with Git integration (`design.freecodecamp.org`, project `fcc-design`). Pushes to `main` deploy production. Build output: `apps/docs/dist/`. See [docs/runbooks/deploy-docs.md](./docs/runbooks/deploy-docs.md).
- **Registry** → the docs site is the registry: component markdown pages and raw source endpoints are generated at docs build time and ship with every docs deploy.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue at <https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/UIkit/issues>. Include reproduction steps, expected behaviour, and observed behaviour. For visual regressions, attach the Playwright diff PNG from `apps/docs/test-results/`.

## Reporting security issues

Do **not** open a public issue - follow the disclosure process in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
